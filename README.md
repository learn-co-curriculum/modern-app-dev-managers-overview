# What is Software Development?

## Learning Goals

- Define software development.

## Introduction

A computer can perform millions of calculations in seconds and underpins pretty
much every system in the modern world. However, computers can’t think for
themselves. A computer will do exactly what you tell it to do. For example, if
you try to delete important files from a computer, it won’t stop you!

We can instruct the computer what to do using code, i.e., a language that a
computer can understand. People who can use code to communicate with a computer
are called programmers. However, simply being able to write instructions doesn’t
necessarily mean someone can create complex applications.

## Software Development

Software is used by pretty much every company in the world. Even companies who
have a non-technical product require some form of software to run their
business. Modern applications can span millions of lines of code and be
developed by thousands of people from all over the world!

Software development is the process of scoping requirements, designing user
workflows, deploying it to users, and providing support. In order to build
modern software, software engineers must know how to work with different
stakeholders and translate requirements into code that can be run on computers.

## Conclusion

We have learned what software development is in this lesson. In the next
lessons, we will learn some fundamental concepts that are key to modern software
development.
